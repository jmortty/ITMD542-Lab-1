                <h2>Hello, I'm Jacob Komla Mortty</h2>
                <p>I am currently pursuing my graduate studies in Information Technology and Management at IIT. I am taking a Full Stack Development course (ITMD 542) to expand my technical skills and to better understand the entire software development process.</p>
                <p>With 6 years of experience in the industry, I've had the opportunity to work for the Ministry of Local Governance from 2019 to 2024 as an Assistant Programmer. I also led a team for a World Bank project called the "Secondary Cities Programme," where we utilized GIS maps to collect and analyze data on landed properties. My role in this project gave me leadership experience and deepened my technical expertise.</p>
                <p>I'm passionate about solving real-world problems using technology, and I'm excited to continue growing my skills in full-stack development. My goal is to integrate my understanding of IT, management, and software development to contribute to impactful projects in the future.</p>
